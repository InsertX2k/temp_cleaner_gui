# How to contribute to Temp_Cleaner GUI?:
Before I start, I would like to thank you for being generous and offering to help me with fixing bugs or adding new features to my program.
I'd like to also reassure you that contributing to Temp_Cleaner GUI is much easier than you might think it is, all you have to do is *just* following the simple step-by-step instructions given below and you will be a contributor in less than a few minutes.
* Download the latest source file and the `translations.py` file

***Why?***


You will need to download the `translations.py` file if you want to make changes to the strings (basically the text of any widget of the UI) of the program.


You will need to download the latest source file on your computer to be able to edit it with your own favorite code editor.

### How can I find the latest source file?

* First, Make sure you're in the `main` branch
* Go to the **Releases** page (Just click on the releases link on the right panel of the page).
* Check which version number is the latest.
* Go back to the **Code** page again (basically the page you saw the source files in)
* Search for the appropriate source file according to the version number you just checked.
**For example:** If the latest version number is `v5.1-stable`, it's source file will be named `temp_cleaner_gui_r5.1.py`.

(Basically ignore the release status and treat the `v` as if it was `r`)

After downloading both the latest source file and the `translations.py` file, You can processed to the next step.

* Make changes to the latest source file you just downloaded using your favorite code editor.

I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) alongwith [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) because of IntelliSense Support (Pylance), but if you have a good IDE with IntelliSence support feel free to use it.

After you make changes to your file, **You need to decide whether you want to publish your edits as a new version or an update to an existing version.**

* If you want to publish them as an update to an existing version:

All you have to do is just pull requesting the file you just edited (to the `main` branch of course), and I will review your changes myself and I will commit them to the `main` branch if they are good enough to be on the next update of **Temp_Cleaner GUI**.

* If you want to publish them as a whole new version:

You need to add the suffix `-new_version` to the name of your file **(DO NOT remove the version number from the file name)** and create a pull request to the `main` branch and I will review your changes myself and give them a new version number and commit them to the `main` branch if they are good enough to be commited.

### Don't worry about accepting your changes, because there is a high chance that I accept them and commit them (like 90-95%) if you put effort to your changes.

**If your pull request gets commited by any of this repository's administrators or Maintainers, You should have your name listed immediately in the contributors list, if not, it should appear within a few minutes or days, just be patient.**

***If you have any questions, don't hesitate to create an issue describing your question properly and appropriately, and we will try to help you as soon as possible.***
