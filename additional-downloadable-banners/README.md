## Additional Downloadable Banner files for Temp_Cleaner GUI v1.52 Update 2 <br/>
This folder contains some additional downloadable banners for the program **Temp_Cleaner GUI Project** that are made by either me or others. <br/>
If you want to upload yours here, simply create a **pull request** or an **issue** and I will post yours here. <br/>
Feel free to use them in public, **except when confirmed by the publisher to not to do so.** <br/>
<br/>
### How to install banner files ? <br/>
Simply open the directory where you have the program **Temp_Cleaner GUI** installed in (in case you used the installer with the default configuration, it will be either in **Program files (x86)** folder or **Program Files** folder if your PC is 32-bit) <br/>
Then rename the file `banner.png` to `banner.png.old` <br/>
Then download a custom banner file from here or make yourself a new one, then *copy and paste* in into the directory where you have the program **Temp_Cleaner GUI** is installed in <br/>
Then rename the new banner you just pasted to `banner.png` instead of `<somerandomwords>.png` or whatever it was. <br/>
<br/>
If you are having issues with the installation, feel free to open an **issue**, and I won't be replying you at all **(Just joking)** <br/>
<br/>
### Where's the founder's banner? <br/>
I won't be posting it here **(because as the name suggests)**, it is made only for the founder of the project!.
