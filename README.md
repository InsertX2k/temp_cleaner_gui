## How to create your own banner for Temp_Cleaner GUI's Main Page : <br/>
***If you don't know what the banner is:***
![This is the banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62176660/183706131-db73265e-f68b-4613-8c5c-d0f844a3a026.jpg)
***Simply, the banner is that banner marked in orange***

Going from **Update 2** of **version 1.52** onwards, You can change the image of that banner by yourself if (for some reason), you feel like it is boring.

Changing the banner image can be done easily by going to the **directory** where **Temp_Cleaner GUI** is installed (i.e. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Temp_Cleaner GUI v5.0-stable (x64)`) and replacing the file `banner.png` with the appropriate one.
#### If you don't know how to get the installation folder of Temp_Cleaner GUI, consider reading [this article](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-find-programs-install-location/) (click the word "this article", it is a link by the way) on how to find the installation directory of a program. (not affiliated)

Here are some standards that you must keep in mind if you want to make one by yourself:

* **Resolution :** **1200x300** (Don't go higher than this, or even lower than this) <br/>
* **File extension :** it must be a **png** file (Portable Network Graphics) <br/>
* **Bit Depth :** **32** (Don't go lower than this, or even higher than this) <br/>
* **File Name:** `banner.png` (DO NOT enter anything else) <br/>

***We strongly recommend that you make a copy of the default `banner.png` and make your modifications to it, and when you are done, rename the original one `banner.png.old` in case you changed your mind about your new banner, you can just remove that `.old` suffix and everything will be back to normal.***
