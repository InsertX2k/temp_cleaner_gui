## Download a compiled version: <br/>
**I've moved the official downloads section from this page to the better UI Github page, so feel free to go there to download the compiled version of such software.**
<br/>

## How to compile? <br/>
**In order to properly compile, You will need all of the following :** <br/>
* `Pyinstaller` or `auto-py-to-exe`; any of these software can be installed using Python PIP through any of the following appropriate commands : <br/>
```
pip install pyinstaller
```
Or:

```
python -m pip install pyinstaller
```

<br/>

```
pip install auto-py-to-exe
```
Or:
```
python -m pip install auto-py-to-exe
```
<br/>

* **Python Modules** `PIL/pillow` and `WINTCMD` <br/>
```
pip install pillow
```
Or:
```
python -m pip install pillow
```
Or:
```
pip install PIL
```
Or:
```
python -m pip install PIL
```
<br/>

About the module `WINTCMD`, you can download it from the source code files (**of course in this branch**), **and don't forget to include it in the `--hidden-import` option if you will use `Pyinstaller`**. <br/>

<br/>

**Of course [Python 3.9.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is a must have.**

<br/>

**Once you have all the requirements on your computer/workstation, do all of the following :**
* Wait for me to release a good compiling guide.

## What's new in all updates?, Anyone? <br/>
Simply open the tags (or releases) in this repository, this should help you clearly understand every new update to this program and what it does. <br/>

<br/>

## Found a bug?, Got a suggestion for any new features? <br/>
Simply create a new issue, and be sure to properly describe the bug if you are reporting a bug, and if you are suggesting a new feature, clearly describe it in the issue you will create, and tell us why should we add this feature (basically why do you think this feature will be useful), and we will try to reply you as fast as possible. <br/>

## How to change the banner in Update 2? : <br/>


The best feature of Update 2 in Version 1.52 of **Temp_Cleaner GUI**, is that it allows for a better customization for the banner image, if you really want to change the banner image of the program, please first install it on your computer, then go to the path where you installed it in, then go to the file `banner.png` and make the changes you wish to it. <br/>


If you would consider replacing it with a new file, Feel free to do, I won't prevent you so, but before you go, please keep in mind the new picture must be with the *following properties :* <br/>


**Resolution :** **1200x300** (Don't go higher than this, or even lower than this) <br/>


**File extension :** it must be a **png** file (Portable Network Picture or whatever is it called) <br/>


**Bit Depth :** 32 (Don't go lower than this, or even higher than this) <br/>


<br/>

## Download an already compiled release with installer: <br/>
