**A Free and Open-Source program to help you free up disk space on your PC that is way more powerful than you might expect**<br/>

## âš  Attention users: Please keep your copy of Temp_Cleaner GUI up-to-date!
The built-in updater program should help you stay up-to-date, only if you download the latest release whenever prompted to do, the main and most important reason why you should stay up-to-date is that I sometimes discover bugs and fix them in the recent version (pretty much like any software or operating system that exists in this world), also I sometimes add new useful features (more like the new Android cleaner feature introduced in v7.0-testing) and I need some testers to tell me how do they perform and report bugs to me when necessary, also if you open a support ticket in the [SourceForge page](https://sourceforge.net/p/temp-cleaner-gui/tickets/), it will be closed if the user who created the ticket is not running the most recent version of Temp_Cleaner GUI, thank you for understanding.

#### Also stop downloading older versions of Temp_Cleaner GUI from the sourceforge files section, use the [downloads page of the website instead](https://insertx2k.github.io/temp_cleaner_gui/downloads.html), it does always redirect you to the latest build.

## How to create your own banner for Temp_Cleaner GUI's Main Page : <br/>
***If you don't know what the banner is:***
![This is the banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62176660/183706131-db73265e-f68b-4613-8c5c-d0f844a3a026.jpg)
***Simply, the banner is that banner marked in orange***

Going from **Update 2** of **version 1.52** onwards, You can change the image of that banner by yourself if (for some reason), you feel like it is boring.

Changing the banner image can be done easily by going to the **directory** where **Temp_Cleaner GUI** is installed (i.e. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Temp_Cleaner GUI v5.0-stable (x64)`) and replacing the file `banner.png` with the appropriate one.
#### If you don't know how to get the installation folder of Temp_Cleaner GUI, consider reading [this article](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-find-programs-install-location/) (click the word "this article", it is a link by the way) on how to find the installation directory of a program. (not affiliated)

Here are some standards that you must keep in mind if you want to make one by yourself:

* **Resolution :** **1200x300** (Don't go higher than this, or even lower than this) <br/>
* **File extension :** it must be a **png** file (Portable Network Graphics) <br/>
* **Bit Depth :** **32** (Don't go lower than this, or even higher than this) <br/>
* **File Name:** `banner.png` (DO NOT enter anything else) <br/>

***We strongly recommend that you make a copy of the default `banner.png` and make your modifications to it, and when you are done, rename the original one `banner.png.old` in case you changed your mind about your new banner, you can just remove that `.old` suffix and everything will be back to normal.***

<br/>
