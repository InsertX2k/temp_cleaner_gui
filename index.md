## Introduction <br/>
When you want to clean up your storage device to free up some space on it, of course you'd think of a something named as "Temporary Folders Cleaners" or a something like "CCleaner" for short, and you don't know that most of these preparatory software are collecting information about you, including the files you delete using their software! <br/>
That really sucks, specially if they got access to your `Recent documents list`, they'd know everything about your behaviour and the files you open on your computer, regardless of how secret are they. <br/>
