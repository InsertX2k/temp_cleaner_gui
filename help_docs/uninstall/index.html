    <h2>
        Uninstalling Temp_Cleaner GUI and removing all of its traces
    </h2>
    <p>
        Uninstalling Temp_Cleaner GUI is easier than expected, and I will be providing you with 3 different methods to safely uninstall Temp_Cleaner GUI from your computer.
    </p>
    <h3>
        By running the built-in uninstaller program from Control Panel
    </h3>
    <p>
        You can uninstall Temp_Cleaner GUI by running the built-in uninstaller program just by going to <strong>Control Panel > Programs and Features > Programs > Temp_Cleaner GUI > Uninstall</strong> and follow on-screen instructions to complete the uninstallation process.
    </p>
    <h3>
        By running the built-in uninstaller program manually
    </h3>
    <p>
        You can uninstall Temp_Cleaner GUI by manually running the built-in uninstaller program from the installation folder of Temp_Cleaner GUI.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Open the installation folder of Temp_Cleaner GUI (usually: <strong>C:\Program Files\Temp_Cleaner GUI</strong>)
        </li>
        <li>
            Look for the file <strong>unins000.exe</strong> or <strong>uninsXXX.exe</strong> (where XXX can be any digits)
        </li>
        <li>
            Right click on it and click <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            A window will appear if UAC (User Account Control) is enabled, press Yes
        </li>
        <li>
            A small dialog box will appear asking you if you want to uninstall Temp_Cleaner GUI, click Yes
        </li>
        <li>
            Wait for the program to finish the uninstallation process, and be sure to stay focused because there might appear some actions that would require some interaction from you.
        </li>
        <li>
            When done, you may see a dialog box that says <strong>successfully uninstalled</strong>, press OK, now you have successfully uninstalled Temp_Cleaner GUI
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Removing files that uninstaller program couldn't remove
    </h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes after running the built-in uninstaller program, a message box will appear saying that some files were left intact, this usually happens when you make your changes to some of Temp_Cleaner GUI's files (like when modifying the banner image or manually changing the settings by editing the file <strong>Config.ini</strong>), in this case, you will need to manually delete all the files the built-in uninstaller program couldn't delete.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Open the installation folder of Temp_Cleaner GUI (usually: <strong>C:\Program Files\Temp_Cleaner GUI</strong>)
        </li>
        <li>
            Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> to select all files in that folder
        </li>
        <li>
            Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Delete</kbd> to permanently delete all selected files
        </li>
        <li>
            Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <strong>Yes</strong> to the dialog box that might appear to you asking you if you want to permanently delete these files.
        </li>
        <li>
            Go back one directory
        </li>
        <li>
            Select the folder named <strong>Temp_Cleaner GUI</strong> and press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Delete</kbd>
        </li>
        <li>
            Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <strong>Yes</strong> to the dialog box that might appear to you asking you if you want to permanently delete that folder.
