        Understanding the Interface of Temp_Cleaner GUI
    </h2>
    <p>
        Temp_Cleaner GUI, features an easy to use and an easily understandable and far from complication graphical user interface (GUI)
    </p>
    <img src="ui0.png" alt="couldn't load help document, please reload this page.">
    <p>
        Below is a table containing more information about what each number means
    </p>
    <table class="table0">
        <tr>
            <th>
                Number
            </th>
            <th>
                Information
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                #1
            </td>
            <td>
                The cleaning preset chooser combobox (Dropdown) <br>
                Click on the down arrow button on the right (or left side, according to your UI language) to choose a cleaning preset. <br>
                A cleaning preset is an option that allows you to automatically select multiple cleaning options just by choosing how you want this program to work. <br>
                <br>
                Usually the most selected preset for everyday cleaning is: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Default Preset (Recommended for Everyday use)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                More cleaning presets are also available: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Maximum Cleaning (Cleans up all sections, thus giving you more disk space)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Empty Recycle Bin Only
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Web Browser Cleaning
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Web Browser Cleaning + Cookies
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cancel Pending Windows Update
                    </li>
                </ul>
                First time users (those who probably has their PC hogged with tons of Temporary files) tend to choose this preset:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Maximum Cleaning (Cleans up all sections, thus giving you more disk space)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                #2
            </td>
            <td>
                Available cleaning options. <br>
                Every cleaning option in Temp_Cleaner GUI is basically a checkbox, as you probably hinted, all you need to do is just checking (clicking) the option you want to clean. <br>
                This puts the selected option in the queue of options to clean, and that option will be cleaned when you start the cleaning process.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                #3
            </td>
            <td>
                Window title <br>
                This is the title of Temp_Cleaner GUI's Window <br>
                This usually shows "Welcome [username] to Temp_Cleaner GUI v[version number]!" <br>
                and if it fails to get the current user name, the title will be only "Welcome to Temp_Cleaner GUI v[version number]!"
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                #4
            </td>
            <td>
                Banner image <br>
                This is basically a banner that sits on top of even the first widget, I put it here because it makes the program looks prettier. <br>
                <i><strong>This banner image is changable (can be changed by you)</strong></i> <br>
                There are two variants of the file of this banner image: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>banner.png</strong> and this is the default banner file that will appear <strong>when you are using Temp_Cleaner GUI on a display with a resolution of 1152x864 or higher</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>bannerlowres.png</strong> and this is the banner file that will appear <strong>when you are using Temp_Cleaner GUI on a display with a resolution of 1024x768 or 800x600</strong>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                So basically, if you need to modify the banner, you will need to <strong>edit one or all of these files which will be stored in the installation folder of Temp_Cleaner GUI</strong>. (for example: <strong>C:\Program Files\Temp_Cleaner GUI</strong>) <br>
                <br>
                <strong id="warn0">Edit them as they are (don't change their resolution or file extension or bit depth or file name)</strong>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <strong><p>
        When you scroll down (using mouse wheel or the scrollbar on the right or left side of the window, depending on the UI language) <br>
        You will see the following new interface elements (widgets).
    </p></strong>
    <img src="ui1.png" alt="couldn't load help document, please reload this page.">
    <strong><p>
        I will also explain what each button and thing does:
    </p></strong>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Number
            </th>
            <th>
                Information
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                #1
            </td>
            <td>
                The "Start cleaning" (may vary between other UI languages) button <br>
                This button is probably the most used button in the history of this program, basically because of what it does, it simply <strong>executes the cleaner to clean all the options you checked previously</strong> <br>
                <strong>This is the button you will need to click after you choose a cleaning preset or check a cleaning option.</strong> <br>
                <br>
                After the cleaning process is complete, Temp_Cleaner GUI will show you a small window (named a messagebox) showing you how many disk space you have just freed up.

            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                #2
            </td>
            <td>
                The "About & Tips" (may vary between other UI languages) button <br>
                When you click this button, it will basically spawn another window in front of you that shows you basic information about your current Temp_Cleaner GUI installation, such as current version, number of contributors to this version, release channel, and support information. <br>
                It also allows you to use various functions, like: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Showing the license of Temp_Cleaner GUI
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Opening Temp_Cleaner GUI's official website
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Checking for program updates
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Showing a list of all donators to this program
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                #3
            </td>
            <td>
                The "Settings" (may vary between other UI languages) button <br>
                It basically launches the settings window that allows you to configure Temp_Cleaner GUI the way you like.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                #4
            </td>
            <td>
                This is a widget showing you what has been cleaned and what hasn't. <br>
                You can clear that list (delete all text written in it) by pressing the <kbd>F6</kbd> key on your keyboard.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
