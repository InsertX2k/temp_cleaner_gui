    <h2>
        Keeping Temp_Cleaner GUI up to date
    </h2>
    <p>
        Temp_Cleaner GUI provides you with an easy and comfortable way to keep it up to date, I will be listing the official 3 methods to check for updates.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Via the built-in Updater program
    </h3>
    <p>
        Temp_Cleaner GUI provides you with a built-in updater program, which allows you to automate the process of checking for updates. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Starting the built-in updater program can be done in two ways
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            When automatic updates check is enabled in settings, Temp_Cleaner GUI will automatically start checking for updates whenever you launch it, and when an update is available, Temp_Cleaner GUI will launch the updater window informing you of a new update.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can launch the built-in updater program if you have the automatic updates check option disabled or you just want to check for updates manually, you may start the built-in updater program by following these instructions: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Launch Temp_Cleaner GUI
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scroll down til there is nothing left and look for the <strong>About</strong> (may vary depending on the UI language) button
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click on it
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click on the button <strong>Update Check</strong> (may vary depending on UI language)
                </li>
                <li>
                    If an update is available, the updater program will launch, showing you the release notes of the latest release and the version number of the latest update. <br> <br> and if there isn't, A message box will appear on your screen telling you that you are up to date.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Manually by going to the Temp_Cleaner GUI's website
    </h3>
    <p>
        You may manually check for (and download) updates from the official Temp_Cleaner GUI's website, this can be useful in case you are running an older version of Temp_Cleaner GUI or your firewall (or antimalware) program blocked Temp_Cleaner GUI from accessing the internet or when you can't access internet on your PC.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Launch Temp_Cleaner GUI
        </li>
        <li>
            Scroll down til there is nothing left and look for the <strong>About</strong> (may vary depending on the UI language) button
        </li>
        <li>
            Go to the <a href="https://insertx2k.github.io/temp_cleaner_gui/downloads.html" target="_blank">official downloads page of Temp_Cleaner GUI</a> (this is a hyperlink by the way)
        </li>
        <li>
            Compare the version in the <strong>About</strong> window with the one in that website.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the version in the website is newer than (number is higher than) the one in the <strong>About</strong> window, then you need to update your release of Temp_Cleaner GUI. <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Click on the appropriate download button on the downloads page according to your architecture and operating system version
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wait for the file to finish downloading
                </li>
                <li>
                    Uninstall the previous installation of Temp_Cleaner GUI (recommended but not obligatory), See <a href="../uninstall/index.html" target="_blank">Uninstalling Temp_Cleaner GUI and removing all of its traces</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Double click (Run) the file you just downloaded
                </li>
                <li>
                    Follow on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            Otherwise, if the version in the website is equal to the one in the <strong>About</strong> window, then you are up to date and you don't need anything else.
        </li>
    </ul>
