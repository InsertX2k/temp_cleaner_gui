Temp_Cleaner GUI build script file

A Script file used to automate the process of building the Temp_Cleaner GUI application from source.

Due to the limitations of pyinstaller, this script needs to be ran from the same architecture
and operating system as the intended build target system, for example, if you are targeting an x86_64 (64-bit)
Windows 10 system, you must run this script on an x86_64 (64-bit) Windows 10 system.

If you are here to customize the building process, ONLY modify the constants, DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING ELSE,
YOU DON'T NEED TO ADD YOUR FINAL TOUCHES HERE, THIS SCRIPT IS MADE TO ENSURE A SUCCESSFUL BUILD AND WITH GURANTEES
THAT THE COMPILED (BUILT) VERSION RUNS PROPERLY WITHOUT ANY ISSUES.
