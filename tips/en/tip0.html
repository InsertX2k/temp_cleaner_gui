    <h1>Got lost?</h1>
    <p>
        Did you know that <strong>Temp_Cleaner GUI</strong> provides you with a useful help document that covers the basics of using it, it also has a section for first time users.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Opening Help document, the usual way:
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Open Start menu
        </li>
        <li>
            Click "All Programs" (If you are running Windows 8.1 then you need to right click on any empty space on your screen so you can see the option to show all programs first)
        </li>
        <li>
            Look for a folder named "Ziad (Mr.X) Software"
        </li>
        <li>
            Open it
        </li>
        <li>
            Click on the shortcut named "Temp_Cleaner GUI Help"
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you can't open start menu or you don't find that shortcut for some reason, you can still open the help document manually yourself
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Open the directory where Temp_Cleaner GUI is installed in (for example: C:\Program Files\Temp_Cleaner GUI)
        </li>
        <li>
            Open the folder "help_docs"
        </li>
        <li>
            Open the file "index.html"
        </li>
    </ul>
